# bugs-prone-files-analysis

In order to run the script type in a terminal:
`python main.py ~/Downloads/project_name/`

It prints 500 most frequently changed files and save this info as csv file (files.cvs).

The columns in the above cvs file are:
* file name (relative path of the file with code) 
* commits count (number of commits in the file during last year)
* bugs count (number of commits messages that contain pattern ` bug`)
* authors (number of authors which change the file)
* file size (code file size in bytes)
* median (median of all the code file sizes)
* xTimes bigger than median (`file size`/`median` in order to understand how big is the code file comparing to the median)
* metric (`commits*(bugs+1)*bigger_than_median` - so it's just simple product of 3 main parameters that can help to understand if the file is bugs prone or not)

Once you open csv file just sort it descending using the last column - `metric` and see what files are likely need refactoring.

For instance, let's analyze https://github.com/TelegramMessenger/Telegram-iOS repository using this script. These are first 3 lines sorted by last column: 

| file name        | commits count           | bugs count  | authors | file size | median | xTimes bigger than median | metric = commits*(bugs + 1)*bigger_than_median |
| ------------- |----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| submodules/TelegramUI/Sources/ChatController.swift | 211 | 1 | 2 | 670211 | 11810 | 56.7 | 23948.2 |
| submodules/TelegramApi/Sources/Api1.swift | 83 | 1 | 2 | 1097420 | 11810 | 92.9 | 15425.2 |
| submodules/TelegramPresentationData/Sources/PresentationStrings.swift | 163 | 1 | 2 | 421412 | 11810 | 35.68 | 11632.5 |

We can see that `ChatController.swift` is being changed very often almost every working day there is a commit to this file and considering it's size 670k (or 11k lines of code!) we can assume that probability of introducing bugs is rather high for this file. The second item is file with API and it seems to me it could be autogenerated so we can skip it as well as the third one which is autogenerated too.
